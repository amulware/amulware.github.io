Engineering Executive & Leader, previously CTO at [Toggl](https://toggl.com/mission/ "About Toggl"). Based in beautiful Galway, Ireland.
Remote work advocate. 8+ years experience leading software engineers, teams and other engineering leaders.
Passionate about leadership, clean code and sustainability.

I mentor and grow leadership skills and develop strategies to help engineering leaders and teams get the right things done better.

I’m experienced in building teams, cross-department collaboration, leadership development, remote work, SaaS & engineering strategy, and scaling and maturing engineering organisations.
I’d love to help you do any of the above, or solve entirely new challenges!
